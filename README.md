### Hi there 👋

<!--
**WilliamZYR/WilliamZYR** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

🌱 Hi, I am William! I am currently an undergraduate student in University of Waterloo, Studying Computer Science and Finance.

I have strong interests in capital market and computer technology. I believe the combination of these two fields will lead to more effective financial services.

Besides, I also enjoy programming very much. I like the feeling of creating things!

In my leisure time, I enjoy reading, watching movies, and playing badminton!
