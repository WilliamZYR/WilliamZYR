### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


ðŸŒ± Hi, I am William! I am currently an undergraduate student in University of Waterloo, Studying Computer Science and Finance.

I have strong interests in capital market and computer technology. I believe the combination of these two fields will lead to more effective financial services.

Besides, I also enjoy programming very much. I like the feeling of creating things!

In my leisure time, I enjoy reading, watching movies, and playing badminton!
